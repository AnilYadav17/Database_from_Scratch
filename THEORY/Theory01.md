DIFFERENCE BETWEEEN DBMS AND RDBMs:

DBMS  is a general software use to manage Database,but RDBMS is a adavanced type of DBMS that store data in related tables.
Every RDBMS is a DBMS but DBMS is not an RDBMS.
In case of DBMS data maybe stored in files, but in RDBMS data is stored in tables.


1.SQL(:Structured Query Language)
    It is a standard programming language used to communicate with relational Database management sysetm , it allow usesrs to create , store , retreive , update , delete and manage data stored in relational database.

    It is bridge between user and the database , user send SQL commands to the DBMS, DBMS process those commands to perform the requested operations. 
    
    Standard :- Data is organised 
    Query :- A request mode to the data base to perform and operation. 
    Language ;- A standard language use to communicate with the RDBMS.
    -> Domain Specific language <-
    
    
    ##Features :
    1. Standard language:
    2. Easy to learn : SQL has a simple english like syntax , its support transactions. 
    3. Provides data definition , manipulation and retrieval.
    
    
2. MySQL : 
	It is an Open Source RDBMS that uses SQL (Structured Query language) to store, manage ,retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.
	It stores data in the  form of tables ,consisting of rows and columns and establish relationship between tables using primary keys and  foreign keys.
	The name My :- named after My widenius  daughter of Michael widenious.
	         SQL :- stands for Structured Query Language 
	         
	Why MySQL ?
	i) Open Source -> MySQL community edition is free to download and use.
	ii) Easy to learn.
	iii) High performance -> It is optimised for fast data retrieval and efficient query execution.
	iv) Cross Platform -> It runs on Windows, Linux, Mac ,UNIX etc.
	v) Secure .
	vi) Easy to integrate -> MySQL integrates easily with java, python, php etc.
	vii) SQL supports.
	viii) Multi user access.
	ix) Large community support.
	
	
#Database Objects are Tables , View ,Database , Index , Stored Procedure, Trigger , Functions. 

3. Types of SQL Languages:
   SQL consists of different categories of commands , each category is designed to perform a specific type of operations on a database such as creating database objects , manipulating data retrieving information, managing user permissions and controlling transactions.

   i) DDL (Data Definition Language)
   ii) DML (Data Manipulation Language)
   iii) DCL (Data Control Language)
   iv) DQl (Data Query Language)
   v) TCL (Transaction Control Language)
	

#### SQL vs MySQL## 
SQL - Language , MySQL - Software
SQL can not store data by itself but MySQL store data in database and  tables.
SQL provides commands such insert, update , delete , select.
MySQL executes SQL commands and returns the result .
SQL is a standard language supported by many database systems.
MySQL is one specific database system that implement SQL.

SQL does not need installation because it is a language. 
but MySQL must be installed on a computer or server before use.

#### HISTORY:
1995 :- MySQL was developed by MYSQLAB  by Michael widenious.
2008	:- Acciverd by SunMicroSystems.
2010 :- Oracle corporation accired SunMicroSystems  and became the owner of MySQL.



(@@hostname) HOST NAME is the unique name assigned to a computer or server on a network so that it can be identified and accessed.
(@@port) PORT : System variable  returns the port number on which mysql server is listening for incoming client connections.

Whenever any application want to connect with MySQL than we need connection details. 
HOST : localhost
PORT : 3306
USERNAME : root
PASSWORD : 1234
DATABASE : university
